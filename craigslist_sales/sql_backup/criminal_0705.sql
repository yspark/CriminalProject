Completei este primeiro estudo com o uso do tarÃ´. Pois bem, nÃ£o sei como lhe dizer mas senti logo desde o inÃ­cio um sentimento profundo de amizade por si. E porquÃª? </p>\r\n        <p>A partir daquilo que vejo atravÃ©s das minhas leituras astrais e do tarÃ´, parece-me que sua vida nem sempre foi fÃ¡cil. E isso, desde a mais tenra idade. Sem querer falar de uma infÃ¢ncia infeliz, uma vez que a InfÃ¢ncia representa essa parte de sonho que estÃ¡ em nÃ³s, pude entender que desde muito cedo vocÃª compreendeu que a vida nÃ£o era um sonho. Acordou cedo para a dura realidade... <br />\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>Curiosamente e falando com conhecimento de causa, a culpa nÃ£o Ã© dos astros. Cada tema Ã© composto por aspectos bons e maus. Em vez de falar de aspectos maus, prefiro falar de &quot;desafios&quot;.</p>\r\n        <p>Tente entender, existem 	vÃ¡rias formas de apreender a astrologia, o tarÃ´ e a vidÃªncia. Algumas pessoas tÃªm uma forma maquinal de ver as coisas. Ou Ã© bom ou Ã© mau. O mundo e a vida nÃ£o sÃ£o como um computador que funciona segundo o binÃ¡rio &quot;BOM&quot; ou &quot;MAU&quot;. Contudo, cada experiÃªncia que vivemos serve para nos fazer crescer e progredir. </p>\r\n        <p><u>Erico,vou ser muito claro e direto consigo</u>: se sua situaÃ§Ã£o presente nÃ£o Ã© aquela que desejava, deve retirar daÃ­ uma liÃ§Ã£o importante. Parece que vocÃª nÃ£o conseguiu superar esses desafios e usar suas energias astrais para construir a vida que gostaria de ter tido. Mas, cuidado, nÃ£o estou a fazer um juÃ­zo de valores mas sim uma reflexÃ£o, que lhe transmito. Ã‰ para que possa perceber melhor a razÃ£o pela qual se sente preso a uma situaÃ§Ã£o difÃ­cil e, sobretudo, o que fazer para sair da mesma.</p>\r\n        <p>Na realidade, os astros deram-lhe uma oportunidade, a partir da data que lhe indiquei, de superar esses &quot;desafios&quot; e conseguir o que deseja. VocÃª vai perceber isso quando lhe falar das minhas previsÃµes para seu futuro. Antes, falemos ainda da sua situaÃ§Ã£o atual.<br />\r\n          Agora, apenas entre nÃ³s, estÃ¡ satisfeito com sua sorte? NÃ£o me parece. Baseando-me no estudo do seu cÃ©u no momento do seu nascimento, fui acometido por umas impressÃµes. Estas impressÃµes parecem me dizer que vocÃª sofre de uma espÃ©cie de melancolia. Essas impressÃµes parecem sugerir que vocÃª sofre de remorsos.  NÃ£o vale a pena perder tempo com arrependimentos nem pensar no passado, porque o que Ã© importante Ã© seu futuro. </p>\r\n        <p>Erico nÃ£o pode fazer nada para mudar o passado mas pode fazer algo para que seu futuro seja melhor. Por isso, desejo ajudÃ¡-lo para que tire partido desse sinal que estÃ¡ inscrito no seu cÃ©u astral e que pode marcar o inÃ­cio de uma enorme sorte.</p>\r\n        <p><u><strong>A evoluÃ§Ã£o da sua situaÃ§Ã£o</strong></u>:</p>\r\n        <p>Normalmente nÃ£o sugiro isto, contudo, gostaria de realizar para vocÃª um grande estudo astral e tarolÃ³gico para os prÃ³ximos 6 meses. Sinto profundamente que estes serÃ£o fundamentais para o resto da sua vida.</p>\r\n        <p>Este estudo aprofundado vai indicar-lhe como vencer os desafios e fazer as escolhas certas no momento oportuno. Sabe, jÃ¡ realizo vidÃªncias hÃ¡ muitos anos, e sei que muitas vezes basta adicionar um nÃºmero a uma grelha, no Ãºltimo minuto, para fazer toda a diferenÃ§a entre a infelicidade e a boa sorte. E isso se aplica a todos os sectores da sua vida. </p>\r\n        <p>Erico, neste e-mail nÃ£o tenho tempo para lhe falar de todos os pormenores. Nem tenho espaÃ§o, pois tenho material para pÃ¡ginas e pÃ¡ginas. Uma vez mais digo-lhe que, na vida nem tudo Ã© bonito nem tudo Ã© cor de rosa mas, neste momento, vocÃª tem a possibilidade de construir mais felicidade para sua vida.</p>\r\n        <p>Se seguir meus conselhos, estou seguro de que vocÃª irÃ¡ vencer os desafios da vida e que, finalmente, vai conhecer a alegria de viver. Tenho a certeza disso. Fui escolhido, entre os melhores videntes do mundo. Penso, por isso, poder afirmar que minhas previsÃµes sÃ£o na maior parte dos casos  corretas. E para si, penso ver muita felicidade se vocÃª tomar as decisÃµes certas nos momentos certos.</p>\r\n        <p>Ã‰ exatamente o que gostaria que fizesse, seguindo os conselhos <a href=\"https://oraculum.clarividencia-gratuita.com/order/32AAEXSUELQNUH12/jodyhaven92@gmail.com/4?utm_source=NLEN-AF-1224-BR-1505-1-40&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=10-GRV-R01-OFERTA\">desta grande vidÃªncia</a> que desejo lhe enviar por iniciativa prÃ³pria. </p>\r\n        <p>Para isso, clique no link a seguir.

Auch m&ouml;chte ich betonen, dass Sie richtig gehandelt haben, indem  Sie sich an mich wandten, denn ich wei&szlig;, dass ich Sie auf den Weg zu Gl&uuml;ck und  Wohlstand f&uuml;hre, die Sie so sehr verdienen.     Als ich vorhin Ihre Bitte  erhielt, hatte ich ein merkw&uuml;rdiges Gef&uuml;hl. Es war eine Art Eingebung, wie ich  sie manchmal habe und die mir zu sagen schien: Du wirst gebraucht! Es war als  ahnte ich, dass f&uuml;r Sie der Zeitpunkt gekommen ist, endlich das wahre Gl&uuml;ck zu  erfahren, das Gl&uuml;ck, das Sie verdienen. Ja, das Sie verdienen.\nIch habe mich also mit Ihrem pers&ouml;nlichen  Fall besch&auml;ftigt, und ich kann es Ihnen jetzt sagen: Ich habe mich nicht  get&auml;uscht &hellip;.\nHier also meine ersten  Empfindungen, die ich Ihnen gegen&uuml;ber hatte:\nEs scheint mir, dass es Ihnen  ein Bed&uuml;rfnis ist, geliebt und bewundert zu werden, und doch sind Sie sich  selbst gegen&uuml;ber kritisch. Gewiss gibt es ein paar Schw&auml;chen in Ihrer  Pers&ouml;nlichkeit, aber seien Sie unbesorgt, gew&ouml;hnlich gelingt es Ihnen, diese  auszugleichen. Sie haben ein betr&auml;chtliches Potential, das Sie nicht zu Ihrem  Vorteil genutzt haben. Nach au&szlig;en sind Sie diszipliniert und es gelingt Ihnen, sich  zu beherrschen, aber im Inneren sind Sie besorgt und sich Ihrer selbst nicht  sicher. Manchmal fragen Sie sich ernsthaft, ob Sie die richtige Entscheidung  getroffen oder richtig gehandelt haben.\nAuch habe ich gesp&uuml;rt, dass Sie ein gewisses Ma&szlig; an  Ver&auml;nderung und Abwechslung sch&auml;tzen und unzufrieden werden, wenn man Sie mit  Einschr&auml;nkungen und Restriktionen umgibt. Sie sind &uuml;berzeugt, ein frei  denkender Mensch zu sein und akzeptieren die Meinung der anderen nur dann, wenn  sie geb&uuml;hrend bewiesen ist. Sie meinen, es ist falsch, sich den anderen zu  leicht zu offenbaren.

Vor nicht allzu langer Zeit sind echte Chancen nahe an Ihnen  vorbeigegangen (ganz besonders eine vor kurzem), aber wegen Ihrer Sorgen haben  Sie auch hier wieder Ihre Chancen vertan und verpasst!\nSeien Sie aber unbesorgt, in  finanzieller Hinsicht wird die Zukunft g&uuml;nstig f&uuml;r Sie sein, in den kommenden  Monaten k&ouml;nnten sich Ihnen neue au&szlig;ergew&ouml;hnliche Gelegenheiten bieten.

Seien  Sie optimistisch und geben Sie den Kampf nicht auf. Nutzen Sie die Hilfe, die ich Ihnen biete und die Sie  auf den Weg zu Gl&uuml;ck und Wohlstand f&uuml;hrt! \n \n \n \n \nIch m&ouml;chte mit Ihnen auch  dieses Problem behandeln, das mir f&uuml;r Sie ganz besonders am Herzen liegt: das  Gef&uuml;hlsleben. Ich wei&szlig;, dass Sie allzu sensibel sind und sehr oft darunter  leiden.\nEs ist h&ouml;chste Zeit, all das  B&ouml;se, das man Ihnen angetan hat, zu vergeben und zu vergessen, ein Blatt wendet  sich, und der Augenblick ist gekommen, gelassen in die Zukunft zu sehen, denn  Sie k&ouml;nnten bald eine auf diesem Gebiet f&uuml;r Sie wichtige Bekanntschaft machen,  um endlich Ihren Weg zu beleuchten. Schauen Sie nicht mehr zur&uuml;ck, Sie m&uuml;ssen  vorw&auml;rts gehen! Ich sage Ihnen, dass Sie auf diesem Gebiet, das Ihnen ganz  besonders zu schaffen macht, mit meiner Hilfe rechnen k&ouml;nnen.\nIhre Pers&ouml;nlichkeit hat sich angesichts  der Entt&auml;uschungen und &Auml;ngste gebildet. Diese in Ihrem Leben sehr fr&uuml;h  eingetretenen gro&szlig;en Liebesentt&auml;uschungen haben die Lage durchaus nicht verbessert.  Ja, es muss eingestanden werden: Ihre starke Sensibilit&auml;t und Ihr gro&szlig;es  Bed&uuml;rfnis nach Liebe und Zuneigung sind niemals ganz befriedigt worden. Das ist  umso schwerwiegender, als Ihr Tierkreiszeichen und vor allem Ihr Aszendent stark  von dieser Sensibilit&auml;t zu lieben und geliebt zu werden gepr&auml;gt sind. Es steht  fest, dass die Nichterf&uuml;llung dieses Wunsches schon fr&uuml;h zu Sperrungen und  Spannungen f&uuml;hrt, die Ihr Leben bereits stark beeinflusst haben.\nWas das Gef&uuml;hlsleben anbetrifft,  zweifeln Sie angesichts des Lebens. Es fehlt Ihnen an Entschlusskraft. Aufgrund  Ihrer wiederholten Misserfolge zweifeln Sie jetzt oft&hellip; viel zu oft! Wir m&uuml;ssen  uns eingestehen, dass die feindseligen Tendenzen in Ihrem Leben wieder einmal  die Oberhand gewinnen.\nDoch es fehlt nicht viel, um diese Tendenz umzukehren,  und wenn Sie mir Ihre Zustimmung geben, k&ouml;nnten sehr bald, beg&uuml;nstigt durch die  vorteilhafte Periode, die ich in dem f&uuml;r Sie hergestellten Video angek&uuml;ndigt  habe, tief greifende Ver&auml;nderungen eintreten&hellip; \n \n \nNach allem, was ich Ihnen  gesagt habe, wird schlie&szlig;lich mit Sicherheit deutlich, wie es &uuml;brigens auch aus  meinen ersten Empfindungen hervorgeht, dass sich Ihre augenblickliche Situation  dank dieser einmaligen astrologischen Konjunktion an Ihrem Astralhimmel positiv  ver&auml;ndern kann. Wie ich Ihnen in der f&uuml;r Sie hergestellten Video-Aufzeichnung sagte, sind Sie zurzeit in den 12 wichtigsten Monaten  Ihres Lebens!\nIch biete dies gew&ouml;hnlich nicht  an, aber f&uuml;r Sie m&ouml;chte ich eine gro&szlig;e pers&ouml;nliche Voraussage f&uuml;r die kommenden  6 Monate realisieren. Warum ein solches Angebot? Ganz einfach deshalb, weil  sich etwas ereignet hat, das in meinem Beruf selten ist; es kommt sehr selten  vor, dass sich jemand in dem Augenblick an mich wendet, in dem in seinem Geburtshoroskop  eine einmalige astrologische Konjunktion eintritt. \nDaher habe ich beschlossen,  Ihnen zu Hilfe zu kommen und Ihnen eine gro&szlig;e pers&ouml;nliche Voraussage f&uuml;r die  n&auml;chsten 6 Monate anzubieten. Normalerweise verlange ich f&uuml;r eine derartige  gro&szlig;e Voraussage ein Honorar von 200 Euro, oder sogar noch mehr, wenn es sich um einen  bedeutenden Gesch&auml;ftsmann oder einen Prominenten handelt, aber Ihr Fall ist so  au&szlig;ergew&ouml;hnlich und Ihre Astralkonjunktion so einzigartig, dass ich nicht m&ouml;chte,  dass Sie aus finanziellen Gr&uuml;nden diesen in Ihrem Leben so wichtigen Wendepunkt  verpassen.\nSo biete ich sie Ihnen f&uuml;r eine  symbolische Gabe an.

Auch m&ouml;chte ich betonen, dass Sie richtig gehandelt haben, indem  Sie sich an mich wandten, denn ich wei&szlig;, dass ich Sie auf den Weg zu Gl&uuml;ck und  Wohlstand f&uuml;hre, die Sie so sehr verdienen.     Als ich vorhin Ihre Bitte  erhielt, hatte ich ein merkw&uuml;rdiges Gef&uuml;hl. Es war eine Art Eingebung, wie ich  sie manchmal habe und die mir zu sagen schien: Du wirst gebraucht! Es war als  ahnte ich, dass f&uuml;r Sie der Zeitpunkt gekommen ist, endlich das wahre Gl&uuml;ck zu  erfahren, das Gl&uuml;ck, das Sie verdienen. Ja, das Sie verdienen.\r\nIch habe mich also mit Ihrem pers&ouml;nlichen  Fall besch&auml;ftigt, und ich kann es Ihnen jetzt sagen: Ich habe mich nicht  get&auml;uscht &hellip;.\r\nHier also meine ersten  Empfindungen, die ich Ihnen gegen&uuml;ber hatte:\r\nEs scheint mir, dass es Ihnen  ein Bed&uuml;rfnis ist, geliebt und bewundert zu werden, und doch sind Sie sich  selbst gegen&uuml;ber kritisch. Gewiss gibt es ein paar Schw&auml;chen in Ihrer  Pers&ouml;nlichkeit, aber seien Sie unbesorgt, gew&ouml;hnlich gelingt es Ihnen, diese  auszugleichen. Sie haben ein betr&auml;chtliches Potential, das Sie nicht zu Ihrem  Vorteil genutzt haben. Nach au&szlig;en sind Sie diszipliniert und es gelingt Ihnen, sich  zu beherrschen, aber im Inneren sind Sie besorgt und sich Ihrer selbst nicht  sicher. Manchmal fragen Sie sich ernsthaft, ob Sie die richtige Entscheidung  getroffen oder richtig gehandelt haben.\r\nAuch habe ich gesp&uuml;rt, dass Sie ein gewisses Ma&szlig; an  Ver&auml;nderung und Abwechslung sch&auml;tzen und unzufrieden werden, wenn man Sie mit  Einschr&auml;nkungen und Restriktionen umgibt. Sie sind &uuml;berzeugt, ein frei  denkender Mensch zu sein und akzeptieren die Meinung der anderen nur dann, wenn  sie geb&uuml;hrend bewiesen ist. Sie meinen, es ist falsch, sich den anderen zu  leicht zu offenbaren. Zeitweise sind Sie sehr extravertiert, gespr&auml;chig und  gesellig, und dann sind Sie wieder introvertiert, zur&uuml;ckhaltend und reserviert.  Gewisse Anspr&uuml;che, die Sie haben, werden von anderen Menschen vielleicht als  ziemlich unrealistisch eingesch&auml;tzt.Als ich all das &uuml;ber Sie erfuhr,  habe ich beschlossen, meine Forschungen &uuml;ber Ihre Vergangenheit und Ihre nahe  Zukunft fortzusetzen, indem ich die Sterne und die Tarot-Karten befragte.

Como lhe disse anteriormente, sinto  entre nÃ³s uma profunda ligaÃ§Ã£o espiritual e, por isso, Ã© perfeitamente normal  que me pergunte o seguinte: Porque  Ã© que  o Erico, ainda nÃ£o me pediu para eu realizar  sua grande vidÃªncia? Pensava que lhe tinha demonstrado toda a atenÃ§Ã£o e afeto  que dediquei ao seu caso, ao.</p>\r\n        <p>Erico, tenho muitÃ­ssimas coisas para lhe revelar sobre si, sobre sua  personalidade, sobre suas esperanÃ§as e sobre seus desejos mais secretos. Desta  forma, estudando seu futuro atravÃ©s dos astros, do tarÃ´ e da vidÃªncia direta, me  apercebi que vocÃª parece ter dificuldades em se afirmar como a pessoa que Ã© na  realidade. Isso Ã© lamentÃ¡vel pois vocÃª poderia obter uma sensÃ­vel melhoria em  todos os aspectos da sua vida, bastando para isso que vocÃª se afirmasse e fosse  mais seguro de si. </p>\r\n        <p>Pois bem, por essa razÃ£o decidi lhe oferecer  um presente. Trata-se dos ensinamentos aos iniciados, que eu reservo unicamente  para as pessoas que considero serem capazes e dignas de beneficiar deles. Ã‰  esse seu caso. Trata-se de tÃ©cnicas secretas, muitas fÃ¡ceis de aplicar, e que  lhe vÃ£o trazer uma seguranÃ§a total em quaisquer circunstÃ¢ncias.     </p>\r\n        <p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://oraculum.clarividencia-gratuita.com/order/NPXGV5V9U4L7SSZ4/jodyhaven92@gmail.com/4?utm_source=NLEN-AF-1224-BR-1505-1-40&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=10-GRV-R03\">Para descarregar este presente gratuito no valor de 49  dÃ³lares, <br />\r\n          clique no link acima</a>.</p>\r\n        <p>Neste momento Erico, gostaria de lhe falar da sua situaÃ§Ã£o pessoal e da  renovaÃ§Ã£o que vai acontecer na sua vida e que vai comeÃ§ar exatamente daqui a 7  dias e 8 horas. Os astros, o tarÃ´ e a numerologia confirmam o que acabei de  dizer: vocÃª chegou a um momento crucial da sua vida. AlÃ©m do mais, o fato de  vocÃª  ter solicitado minha ajuda,  precisamente neste perÃ­odo de profundas mudanÃ§as, Ã© para mim um sinal claro e  nÃ­tido que os nossos caminhos estavam destinados a se cruzar.

Eben noch habe ich in meiner Mailbox  nachgesehen und nichts von Ihnen gefunden. Ich dachte doch, dass Sie diese  au&szlig;ergew&ouml;hnliche Chance nutzen w&uuml;rden, die ich Ihnen gew&auml;hrte. Hunderte von  Menschen schreiben mir jeden Tag und vertrauen mir Ihre Probleme an. Ich kann  nicht allen diesen Menschen helfen, und so w&auml;hle ich ein paar wenige  Privilegierte aus, zu denen Sie geh&ouml;ren. Ich gebe Ihnen den Link, mit dem Sie  zu dem Video gelangen, das ich f&uuml;r Sie aufgenommen habe. Dieses Video ist f&uuml;r  Ihre Zukunft sehr wichtig, Dana!  Deshalb <strong><a href=\"https://oraculum.wahrsagen-chris.com/order/H4RAAQS5B9RPEXRS/jodyhaven92@gmail.com/4?utm_source=NLEN-AF-1224-DE-1505-2-60&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=10-GPR-R02_VID\">fordere ich Sie auf, unverz&uuml;glich hier zu klicken,  um dieses Video anzusehen</a></strong>.</p>\r\n        <p>Ich k&uuml;mmere mich n&auml;mlich nur um  die Menschen, bei denen meine Intuition und meine hellseherische Gabe mir  sagen, dass ich ihr Leben positiv ver&auml;ndern kann. Genau das sp&uuml;rte ich das  erste Mal, als ich Ihre ersten Voraussagen aufgestellt habe. Heute sp&uuml;re ich  das noch in verst&auml;rktem Ma&szlig;e. Wenn ich mich auf Ihren Namen und Ihr geistiges &bdquo;Bild&ldquo;  konzentriere, sp&uuml;re ich ein starkes hellseherisches Band zwischen uns.</p>\r\n        <p>Dank meiner telepathischen Kr&auml;fte  kann ich mich mit Ihrem Unterbewusstsein verbinden, und eben erst habe ich eine  psycho-telepathische Verbindung mit Ihnen hergestellt. Dana, ich habe gemerkt, dass Sie  unter dem Zwang gewisser negativer Gedanken stehen, die Sie daran hindern, den  verdienten Erfolg und das Gl&uuml;ck zu erreichen...</p>\r\n        <p>Um Ihnen zu beweisen, welche Bedeutung  ich Ihrem pers&ouml;nlichen Fall und Ihrem Gl&uuml;ck beimesse, sende ich Ihnen heute  eine kleine Brosch&uuml;re, die Ihnen praktisch zeigt, wie Sie alle Ihre negativen  Gedanken, Ihre Zweifel, Ihre begrenzenden Gedanken beseitigen, die Sie daran  hindern, Ihr wahres Schicksal zu leben.</p>\r\n        <p>Dana, wenn die Menschen mich befragen, verlange ich  gew&ouml;hnlich f&uuml;r diesen praktischen und &bdquo;magischen&ldquo; F&uuml;hrer 30 Euro. Ihnen schenke ich  ihn gerne, denn ich wei&szlig;, dass die Anleitungen, die ich Ihnen darin offenbare,  Ihr Leben verwandeln k&ouml;nnen. Ebenso wie die gro&szlig;e Voraussage, die ich f&uuml;r Sie  realisieren m&ouml;chte, indem ich Sie von diesem au&szlig;ergew&ouml;hnlichen Angebot  profitieren lasse.</p>\r\n        <p>Warum also verweigern Sie die  Hilfe, um die Sie mich doch vor wenigen Tagen gebeten haben? Wenn Sie sich an  mich gewandt haben, so gab es doch einen Grund daf&uuml;r. Dieser Grund liegt auf  der Hand: Sie brauchen jemanden, der sich wirklich um Sie k&uuml;mmert, um Ihnen bei  den wichtigen Entscheidungen des Lebens zu helfen.</p>\r\n        <p>Dana, ich bin der Freund, der Vertraute, der Verb&uuml;ndete, der &bdquo;geistige&ldquo;  Komplize, der Ihnen die Wege zum Erfolg &ouml;ffnen wird. Dazu aber m&uuml;ssen Sie mir  antworten und die Hand ergreifen, die ich Ihnen ausstrecke.</p>\r\n        <p>In wenigen Tagen m&uuml;sste ein  au&szlig;ergew&ouml;hnliches Ereignis f&uuml;r Sie eintreten. Mit meinen Ratschl&auml;gen k&ouml;nnten  Sie sogar unversch&auml;mtes Gl&uuml;ck haben und ein gro&szlig;es Los gewinnen. Ich habe diese  M&ouml;glichkeit gesehen, und mit meiner Hilfe k&ouml;nnen Ihre finanziellen Probleme der  Vergangenheit angeh&ouml;ren. Alles h&auml;ngt von Ihnen ab. Wie dem auch sei, lesen Sie  die Brosch&uuml;re durch, die meiner E-Mail beigef&uuml;gt ist, es ist mir ein Vergn&uuml;gen,  Ihnen diese zu schenken.</p>\r\n        <p><strong><a href=\"https://oraculum.wahrsagen-chris.com/order/WMJULQJN8PWGE0OE/jodyhaven92@gmail.com/4?utm_source=NLEN-AF-1224-DE-1505-2-60&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=10-GPR-R02\">Hier klicken, um mich zu bitten, Ihre gro&szlig;e  Voraussage zu realisieren</a></strong><strong> </strong></p>\r\n        <p>Dana, ich erwarte Ihre Antwort in den kommenden Stunden.</p>\r\nIhr Freund und Vertrauter,<p><img title=\"Chris\" src=\"http://www.wahrsagen-chris.com/images/email/signature-chris.png\" alt=\"Chris\" width=\"100\" height=\"50\" /></p></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td style=\"background-color: #efe3cb;

Ich wundere mich  dar&uuml;ber, denn seit Ihrer ersten E-Mail habe ich in Ihnen den starken Wunsch  nach einer besseren Zukunft versp&uuml;rt. Aus der ersten Analyse, die ich f&uuml;r Sie erstellt  habe, geht deutlich hervor, dass sehr gl&uuml;ckliche Momente auf Sie warten, wenn  Sie diese zu ergreifen wissen. Ich stelle mir eine weitere Frage: &bdquo;Hat Dana sich die Zeit  genommen, das Video anzusehen, dass ich speziell f&uuml;r sie aufgenommen habe? <strong><a href=\"https://oraculum.wahrsagen-chris.com/order/46MLGMQCFZSER58O/jodyhaven92@gmail.com/4?utm_source=NLEN-AF-1224-DE-1505-2-60&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=10-GPR-R03_VID\">Schnell hier  klicken, um dieses Video anzusehen.</a></strong></p>\r\n        <p>Dana, um Ihnen zu  zeigen, dass ich mir wirklich Gedanken um Sie mache, sende ich Ihnen diese kleine  Brosch&uuml;re mit sehr einfachen, geheimen Techniken, um das Herz der Menschen zu  erobern, die Ihnen gefallen. Ich war der Meinung, dass Ihnen diese magischen  Techniken helfen werden, ein besseres emotionales Gleichgewicht zu erlangen.</p>\r\n        <p>Bei meinen letzten  telepathischen Erforschungen wie auch bei den letzten Karten, die ich f&uuml;r Sie  gezogen habe, wobei ich mich auf Ihre derzeitigen Emotionen und Gef&uuml;hle konzentriert  habe, sp&uuml;rte ich deutlich einen psychischen &bdquo;Knoten&ldquo; auf diesem Gebiet. Jeden  Tag, wenn ich mich auf Ihren pers&ouml;nlichen Fall konzentriere, lerne ich Ihre Empfindungen  und Ihr astro-psychisches Verhalten besser kennen.</p>\r\n        <p>So habe ich gemerkt,  dass&nbsp; es ein Problem in der, wie ich es nenne,  &bdquo;emotionalen Sph&auml;re&ldquo; gibt. Indem ich meine Gedanken auf die Anderen  projizierte, glaubte ich mehrere starke emotionale Schmerzen zu erkennen&hellip; Diese&nbsp;&bdquo;Narben&ldquo;  scheinen Sie heute noch zu peinigen und verursachen in Ihrem Kopf und Ihrem  Herz noch immer gro&szlig;e Qualen. Sie leben leidenschaftlich, und bei der geringsten  Verletzung Ihrer Sensibilit&auml;t geraten Sie vollkommen aus der Fassung. Sie  m&uuml;ssen lernen, diese Emotionen zu beherrschen, und ich bin da, um Ihnen zu helfen.</p>\r\n        <p>Dana, heute  Morgen, habe ich drei Tarot-Karten f&uuml;r Sie gezogen. Wirklich, seit unserer  Begegnung m&ouml;chte ich Ihnen helfen, denn ich sp&uuml;re eine tiefe psychologische  Verwandtschaft zwischen uns. Und je mehr Zeit vergeht, desto st&auml;rker f&uuml;hle ich  mich verleitet, mich pers&ouml;nlich um Ihren Fall zu k&uuml;mmern.</p>\r\n        <p align=\"center\"><strong><a href=\"https://oraculum.wahrsagen-chris.com/order/YABMPPMUOLATRKTK/jodyhaven92@gmail.com/4?utm_source=NLEN-AF-1224-DE-1505-2-60&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=10-GPR-R03\">Hier klicken, um Ihre gro&szlig;e Voraussage und Ihr  kostenloses Geschenk zu erhalten:\r\n              <br />\r\n          &bdquo;Wie verf&uuml;hren Sie mit Sicherheit die Person, an der Sie interessiert sind?&raquo;</a></strong></p>\r\n        <p>Hier nun die drei Karten,  die ich gezogen habe und die meiner Meinung nach die geheimen Wahrheiten ausdr&uuml;cken,  die Ihr gef&uuml;hlsm&auml;&szlig;iges und emotionales Schicksal&nbsp; &bdquo;spinnen&ldquo;. Die erste Karte stellt den  Ausgangspunkt dar, die Ursache, den Beginn der jetzigen emotionalen&nbsp; Situation. Diese Karte geh&ouml;rt der  Vergangenheit an, das was Sie gerade hinter sich gelassen haben.</p>\r\n        <p>Ich habe die F&uuml;nf der  Schwerter gezogen: Es ist keine einfache Karte. Dieses Arkanum scheint mir  sagen zu wollen, dass viele Menschen versucht haben, Sie von hinten  anzugreifen, ihre F&auml;higkeiten zu untergraben gesunde Beziehungen mit den  Menschen zu pflegen, die Ihnen lieb sind. Diese Karte scheint mir auch  anzuzeigen, dass Sie vielleicht in einer &bdquo;ungesunden&ldquo; Umgebung gelebt haben,  oder auf jeden Fall in einer Umgebung, die nicht sehr geeignet war, Ihre  Herzenseigenschaften und harmonischen F&auml;higkeiten zu pflegen.&nbsp; </p>\r\n        <p>Als ich diese Karte  umdrehte, hatte ich eine Blitzvision. Ich sah Sie in einer Gruppe von Menschen,  die &uuml;ber Sie lachten. Waren Sie in Ihrer Jugend das Opfer der Boshaftigkeit der  Anderen? Ich glaube das hat in Ihrem Herz und Ihrer Psyche tiefe Spuren  hinterlassen, die Ihnen noch heute zu schaffen machen.</p>\r\n        <p>Ihre augenblickliche Situation:</p>\r\n        <p>Sie l&auml;sst sich in der Karte  zusammenfassen, die ich gezogen habe: der Bube der St&auml;be. Diese Karte ist sehr  positiv, da sie das Eintreffen guter Nachrichten in einer mehr oder weniger  nahen Zukunft anzeigt. Diese Karte bedeutet auch Ver&auml;nderung, und ich glaube  daher, dass in den n&auml;chsten Stunden oder Tagen Unvorhergesehenes f&uuml;r Sie  eintreten kann. Auch beim Umdrehen dieser Karte hatte ich eine Blitzvision:<br />\r\n          Ich habe Sie sehr unbefangen  und sicher vor anderen Menschen gesehen. Dann folgten Eindr&uuml;cke auf diese  Blitzvision. Haben Sie eine neue T&auml;tigkeit aufgenommen, oder sind Sie gerade  dabei, Aktivit&auml;ten zu beginnen, f&uuml;r die Sie eine besondere Leidenschaft  versp&uuml;ren? In diesem Falle haben Ihre Projekte beste Erfolgsaussichten. Es  handelt sich um wichtige Projekte, denn sie d&uuml;rften zu neuen Begegnungen und  warum nicht auch zu einer neuen Liebe f&uuml;hren.</p>\r\n        <p>Die Entwicklung Ihrer  Situation: die nahe Zukunft</p>\r\n        <p>Dana, ich habe die  7 der Kelche gezogen. Diese Karte bedeutet Romantik, Liebe, Vergn&uuml;gen. Diese  sehr positive Karte scheint anzuzeigen, dass Sie vielleicht eine gro&szlig;e Liebe  finden, ein sehr starkes, leidenschaftliches Gef&uuml;hl. Ich hatte jedoch gewisse  Eindr&uuml;cke, die in mir den Gedanken wachrufen, dass Sie sich davor h&uuml;ten  sollten, zu sehr auf den Wolken zu schweben und die Wirklichkeit zu vergessen,  in der Sie leben. Ich habe den Eindruck, dass Sie sehr schnell&nbsp; zwischen zwei Entscheidungen hin- und her gerissen  sein k&ouml;nnten. Und Sie k&ouml;nnten sich vielleicht gerade da nicht entscheiden. Diese  Karte zeigt an, dass man sich vor &Uuml;bertreibungen h&uuml;ten soll, die Ihr  Urteilsverm&ouml;gen bei diesen wichtigen Entscheidungen in naher Zukunft  beeintr&auml;chtigen k&ouml;nnten.</p>\r\n        <p align=\"center\"><strong><a href=\"https://oraculum.wahrsagen-chris.com/order/YABMPPMUOLATRKTK/jodyhaven92@gmail.com/4?utm_source=NLEN-AF-1224-DE-1505-2-60&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=10-GPR-R03\">Hier klicken, um Ihre gro&szlig;e Voraussage und  Ihr kostenloses Geschenk zu erhalten:<br />\r\n        &bdquo;Wie verf&uuml;hren Sie mit Sicherheit die Person, an der Sie interessiert sind?&ldquo;</a></strong></p>\r\n        <p>Ja, ich m&ouml;chte Ihnen Ihre  gro&szlig;e Gl&uuml;cks- und Liebesvoraussage senden. So werden Sie wissen, wie Sie sich  in den wichtigen Momenten in ein paar Tagen zu verhalten haben. Bei einem Blick  in meine Aufzeichnungen sehe ich, dass es nur noch wenige Stunden sind, bis ein  Aufleben unter der Energie von Arkanum 18, &bdquo;der Mond&ldquo;,&nbsp; in Ihrem Leben seine Wirkung zeigt.</p>\r\n        <p>Dana, dieser  Zyklus&uuml;bergang ist sehr wichtig f&uuml;r Sie, besonders weil die Mondenergien st&auml;rker  als gew&ouml;hnlich sp&uuml;rbar werden. Diese Karte stellt Illusionen dar, Tr&auml;ume und  alles, was das Unterbewusstsein betrifft. Als ich diese Karte zog, sp&uuml;rte ich  sofort, dass der n&auml;chste 28 - Tage - Zyklus &Uuml;berraschungen f&uuml;r Sie bereithalten  kann, die vielleicht nicht immer gut sind.

Estou admirado porque, desde seu primeiro e-mail, vi  em vocÃª uma sincera vontade de conhecer um futuro melhor. O primeiro estudo que  fiz para vocÃª mostra claramente que momentos de grande felicidade estÃ£o Ã  sua  espera, se souber como os agarrar. E eis que surge outra dÃºvida: &quot;SerÃ¡ que  o Erico teve tempo de ver o vÃ­deo que fiz  especialmente para ele?&quot; <a href=\"https://oraculum.clarividencia-gratuita.com/order/3JOL0OKYJOQHD1V0/jodyhaven92@gmail.com/4?utm_source=NLEN-AF-1224-BR-1505-1-40&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=10-GRV-R05_VID\">Clique  aqui rapidamente</a> para poder ver esse vÃ­deo.</p>\r\n          <p>Erico, para lhe demonstrar que me preocupo sinceramente com seu caso, lhe  envio em anexo um pequeno livro que ensina tÃ©cnicas secretas muito simples,  para conquistar o coraÃ§Ã£o das pessoas de quem gosta. Tenho a certeza que essas  tÃ©cnicas mÃ¡gicas vÃ£o ajudar vocÃª a encontrar um melhor equilÃ­brio emocional. </p>\r\n          <p>Efetivamente, desde as Ãºltimas  exploraÃ§Ãµes telepÃ¡ticas que realizei, mas tambÃ©m nas Ãºltimas cartas que tirei  para vocÃª, e me concentrando nas suas emoÃ§Ãµes e nos seus sentimentos atuais,  senti claramente um &quot;nÃ³&quot; psÃ­quico a esse nÃ­vel. Todos os dias, ao me  concentrar no seu caso pessoal, aprendo a conhecer melhor suas vivÃªncias e seu  comportamento astro-psÃ­quico. </p>\r\n          <p>Desta forma, me apercebi que existia  um problema ao nÃ­vel do que eu chamo a &quot;esfera emocional&quot;. Ao  projetar meus pensamentos em direÃ§Ã£o aos outros, acredito ter encontrado vÃ¡rias  tristezas emocionais muito intensas... Tudo indica que ainda hoje essas  &quot;cicatrizes&quot; estÃ£o prejudicando vocÃª, e sÃ£o ainda a causa de bastantes  sofrimentos, tanto mentais quanto afetivos. VocÃª vive apaixonadamente e, para  si, ao menor ataque Ã  sua sensibilidade, vocÃª fica logo num estado alterado. Ã‰  preciso aprender a controlar essas emoÃ§Ãµes e eu estou aqui para ajudar nesse  processo.</p>\r\n          <p>Erico, hoje de manhÃ£, pensando em vocÃª, tirei trÃªs cartas do tarÃ´. Pois Ã©,  desde que nos conhecemos sinto uma enormÃ­ssima vontade de ajudar vocÃª a  resolver seus problemas porque sinto que entre nÃ³s existe uma profunda  afinidade psicolÃ³gica. E quanto mais os dias passam, mais me sinto impelido a  me ocupar pessoalmente do seu caso.</p>\r\n          <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n          <p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://oraculum.clarividencia-gratuita.com/order/67EJHALOUQQKMK7J/jodyhaven92@gmail.com/4?utm_source=NLEN-AF-1224-BR-1505-1-40&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=10-GRV-R05\">Clique aqui para receber sua grande vidÃªncia e seu  presente gratuito:</a><a href=\"https://oraculum.clarividencia-gratuita.com/order/67EJHALOUQQKMK7J/jodyhaven92@gmail.com/4?utm_source=NLEN-AF-1224-BR-1505-1-40&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=10-GRV-R05\"><br />\r\n          &ldquo;Como seduzir com total seguranÃ§a a pessoa que lhe  interessa&rdquo;</a></p>\r\n          <p>Aqui estÃ£o as trÃªs cartas de tarÃ´ que  tirei e que para mim expressam as verdades ocultas que tecem seu destino  sentimental e emocional. A primeira carta represente o ponto de origem, a  causa, o princÃ­pio da sua situaÃ§Ã£o sentimental e emocional atuais. Essa carta  pertence ao passado, ao que acabou de deixar para trÃ¡s.</p>\r\n          <p>Saiu o cinco de espadas: esta carta  nÃ£o Ã© das mais fÃ¡ceis de conviver. Este arcano parece me sugerir que muitas  pessoas jÃ¡ tentaram trair vocÃª pelas costas, a fim de minar as capacidades que  vocÃª possui para manter relaÃ§Ãµes saudÃ¡veis com as pessoas de quem gosta. Esta  carta tambÃ©m me parece indicar que vocÃª pode ter vivido num ambiente  &quot;infectado&quot;, ou pelo menos pouco propÃ­cio a cultivar todas as  qualidades de coraÃ§Ã£o e de harmonia que estÃ£o dentro de si.  </p>\r\n          <p>Quando virei esta carta, tive um  &quot;flash&quot;. Vi que estava no meio de um grupo de pessoas e que essas  pessoas estavam a rir de si. SerÃ¡ que durante sua juventude vocÃª foi vÃ­tima da  malvadez dos outros? Penso que isso terÃ¡ deixado mazelas profundas no seu  coraÃ§Ã£o e na sua psiquÃª, que vocÃª ainda hoje arrasta consigo.   </p>\r\n          <p align=\"center\"><strong><u>Sua situaÃ§Ã£o atual</u></strong></p>\r\n          <p>EstÃ¡ resumida na segunda carta que  tirei, ou seja o valete de paus. Esta carta Ã© muito positiva, no sentido em que  anuncia a chegada de boas notÃ­cias num futuro mais ou menos prÃ³ximo. Esta carta  tambÃ©m simboliza a mudanÃ§a e, por isso, penso que as prÃ³ximas horas e os  prÃ³ximos dias podem reservar-lhe alguns imprevistos. TambÃ©m tive um  &quot;flash&quot; ao virar esta carta.</p>\r\n          <p>Vi que se sentia Ã  vontade e seguro diante dos outros. Depois desse  &quot;flash&quot; fiquei ainda com algumas impressÃµes. VocÃª comeÃ§ou uma nova atividade  ou estÃ¡ prestes a lanÃ§ar-se numa atividade pela qual nutre uma paixÃ£o muito  especial? Se for este o caso, esses projetos tÃªm fortes possibilidades de  sucesso. Esses projetos sÃ£o importantes porque podem estar na origem de novos  reencontros e, porque nÃ£o, de um novo amor?</p>\r\n          <p><strong><u>A evoluÃ§Ã£o da sua situaÃ§Ã£o</u>:</strong> o futuro prÃ³ximo.</p>\r\n          <p>Erico, a terceira carta que tirei foi o 7 de copas. Esta carta representa o  romantismo, o amor, os prazeres. Esta carta muito positiva parece querer me  indicar que vocÃª poderia encontrar um grande amor, algo de muito forte, muito  passional. Contudo, fiquei com algumas impressÃµes que me fazem pensar que vocÃª  devia ter cuidado, nÃ£o ter a cabeÃ§a nas nuvens e nÃ£o se esquecer da realidade Ã   sua volta. Tenho impressÃ£o que vocÃª pode estar muito perto de hesitar entre  duas escolhas importantes a fazer na sua vida. E, precisamente, vocÃª poderia  ter tendÃªncia para nÃ£o saber qual escolher. Esta carta indica que deve ter  muito cuidado com os abusos que podem alterar sua capacidade de decisÃ£o  relativamente Ã s importantes escolhas que vai ter de fazer num futuro  prÃ³ximo.  </p>\r\n          <p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://oraculum.clarividencia-gratuita.com/order/67EJHALOUQQKMK7J/jodyhaven92@gmail.com/4?utm_source=NLEN-AF-1224-BR-1505-1-40&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=10-GRV-R05\">Clique aqui para receber a sua grande vidÃªncia<br />\r\n          <u>&ldquo;Como seduzir com total seguranÃ§a a pessoa que lhe  interessa?&rdquo;</u></a></p>\r\n          <p>Sim, gostaria muito de lhe enviar sua  grande vidÃªncia de sorte e de amor. Desta forma vocÃª ficaria a saber como lidar  com os momentos importantes que vÃ£o se apresentar a si dentro de alguns dias.  Revendo meus apontamentos, vejo que sÃ³ faltam algumas horas para que um  renascimento baseado na energia do arcano 18 &quot;a lua&quot; comece a fazer  sentir sua influÃªncia na sua vida.</p>\r\n          <p>Erico, esta mudanÃ§a de ciclo Ã© muito importante para vocÃª, especialmente porque  as energias da Lua vÃ£o fluir com maior intensidade do que o habitual. Esta  carta representa as ilusÃµes, os sonhos e tudo o que diz respeito ao  inconsciente. Ao tirar esta carta me apercebi de imediato que o prÃ³ximo ciclo  de 28 dias lhe pode reservar surpresas que nem sempre serÃ£o boas. Na realidade,  seu estado de espÃ­rito, suas decisÃµes, correm o risco de ser influenciadas  pelas energias da Lua e vocÃª corre o risco de tomar decisÃµes que podem ser  contrÃ¡rias Ã  sua boa sorte. </p>\r\n          <p>Ã‰ por isso que gostaria de estar ao  seu lado enviando-lhe sua grande vidÃªncia, que lhe dirÃ¡ o que fazer para  beneficiar de todas as oportunidades de sorte que vocÃª vai ter.

Sei que sou insistente  mas Ã© importante que <a href=\"https://oraculum.clarividencia-gratuita.com/order/F1IZBCHGBPUEAHON/jodyhaven92@gmail.com/4?utm_source=NLEN-AF-1224-BR-1505-1-40&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=10-GRV-R07_VID\">veja o vÃ­deo que preparei para  si</a>, para que possa compreender  porque quero tanto ajudar vocÃª.</p>\r\n        <p>Sim, estou preocupado com vÃ¡rias  coisas. Em primeiro lugar, vocÃª nÃ£o me pediu sua grande vidÃªncia. Como quer que  as coisas mudem positivamente na sua vida se continuar a seguir maus caminhos  tal como fez no passado? Estudando seu mapa astral, pude compreender melhor a  razÃ£o pela qual vocÃª nÃ£o conseguiu concretizar todos os potenciais de  felicidade que estavam manifestamente presentes nas estrelas.</p>\r\n        <p>Erico, se hoje nÃ£o desfruta da vida que gostaria de ter, Ã© porque tomou mÃ¡s  decisÃµes. VocÃª nÃ£o tem culpa, Ã© que nÃ£o foi bem aconselhado. Mas nÃ£o deve deixar que isso se repita. De  modo algum. Especialmente durante as prÃ³ximas semanas, jÃ¡ que seus dias vÃ£o ser  abenÃ§oados por uma sorte extraordinÃ¡ria e por muito entendimento.</p>\r\n        <p>Por conseguinte, as possibilidades de  ganhar em jogos de sorte e azar serÃ£o enormes nos prÃ³ximos dias, com um pico de  sorte daqui a menos de uma semana! NÃ£o lhe quero dar falsas esperanÃ§as, jÃ¡ que  tenho uma reputaÃ§Ã£o de mÃ©dium internacional e especialista mundial nas ciÃªncias  parapsicolÃ³gicas a defender. Contudo, &quot;vi&quot; um grande prÃªmio que  poderia resolver uma grande parte dos seus problemas. </p>\r\n        <p>AlÃ©m desta boa notÃ­cia relacionada  com seu futuro econÃ´mico, tambÃ©m pude ver significantes melhorias no seu plano  sentimental. Estou a par de toda a importÃ¢ncia que vocÃª atribui a este aspecto  especial da sua vida, e por isso peÃ§o-lhe que me escute. Sua situaÃ§Ã£o sentimental  pode melhorar rapidamente, se seguir cuidadosamente os conselhos que lhe dou na  grande vidÃªncia que realizei para si. Para isso, peÃ§o-lhe que a aceite clicando  no link abaixo.</p>\r\n        <p><a href=\"https://oraculum.clarividencia-gratuita.com/order/AYYY4CDIJT8OTH3I/jodyhaven92@gmail.com/4?utm_source=NLEN-AF-1224-BR-1505-1-40&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=10-GRV-R07\">Clique aqui para receber seu presente gratuito e sua  vidÃªncia personalizada</a>.</p>\r\n        <p>Erico, todos os dias milhares de pessoas me enviam e-mails solicitando minha  ajuda, e toda a minha atenÃ§Ã£o recai sobre si porque, como jÃ¡ lhe disse, sinto  que existe uma enorme afinidade psicolÃ³gica entre nÃ³s. Sinto que vocÃª Ã© uma pessoa  que tem um coraÃ§Ã£o &quot;infinito&quot;e, sobretudo, vocÃª tem uma sensibilidade  Ã  flor da pele, o que me leva a pensar que vocÃª tem dentro de si dons de mÃ©dium  que nÃ£o utiliza. Mas isso vai mudar, pois o presente que lhe quero enviar  juntamente com sua grande vidÃªncia vai permitir que vocÃª, num abrir e fechar de  olhos, utilize esses maravilhosos potenciais que se encontram dentro de si e  que vÃ£o lhe permitir transformar sua vida de maneira a que ela corresponda a  seus desejos.</p>\r\n        <p>Pois bem, estÃ¡ prometido, vocÃª  decidiu acabar com seus problemas? NÃ£o se esqueÃ§a que estou aqui para ajudar e  aconselhar vocÃª a defender seus interesses da melhor maneira possÃ­vel.

Das Wort Buddha ist\nkein Name, es ist ein Titel oder ein Beiname und bedeutet jemand, der\nwach ist **im Sinne von aufgewacht in der Realitt**.\n\n**Der bekannteste Buddha ist ein Mann namens Siddharta Gautama,** der\nvor 2500 Jahren in Nordindien lebte. Nach jahrelangen Bemhungen gelang\nihm mit 35 Jahren die Erleuchtung, als er sich in tiefer Meditation\nbefand. Whrend den restlichen 45 Jahren seines Lebens reiste er durch\ngroe Teile Nordindiens, um die Lehre des **Wegs zur Erleuchtung** zu\nverbreiten.\n\n**Dana****,**wissen Sie, was der Buddha Gautama entdeckt hat?\nDass die Erleuchtung auf dem Mittelweg liegt; nicht in luxurisem Genuss\naber auch nicht in der Enthaltsamkeit. Auerdem entdeckte er die heute\nbekannten:\n\nVier edlen Wahrheiten \n\n**1. Leben ist Leiden**(Dukkha).\n**2. Die Ursache des Leidens ist das Verlangen**(Tanha).\n**3. Wer aufhrt zu verlangen, leidet nicht mehr.**\n**4. Die Beendigung des Leidens ist durch den edlen achtfachen Pfad\nmglich;**dieser beruht auf rechter 1) Einsicht 2) Denken, 3) Rede 4) Tat\n5) Lebensfhrung 6) Anstrengung (schlechten Instinkte zgeln und gute\nstrken) 7) Achtsamkeit (Meditation) und 8) Konzentration (Fokussierung) \n\n**Buddha Gautama war kein Gott** oder Gottes Prophet und er hat sich\nauch nie als solchen gehalten. Er hat nie behauptet, ein Gttliches Wesen\nzu sein. Vielmehr sah er sich als \"Richtungsweiser fr die anderen. **Im\nBuddhismus gibt es das Konzept von Gott des Schpfers nicht**. Buddha war\nein Mensch, der sich durch enorme Anstrengungen verwandelt und seine\nmenschlichen Grenzen berschritten hat und sich in einem neuen Zustand\ndes Seins **schuf**: ein Wesen der Erleuchtung. \n\n**Der Erleuchtungs-Zustand, den er erreichte, hat 3 Dimensionen:**\n\n1) **Der Zustand der Weisheit**; die Dinge so zu sehen, wie sie wirklich\nsind.\n2) **Die Quelle des Mitgefhls** oder der Liebe, die konstant dem Wohle\naller Wesen dienen.\n3) **Und es ist die totale Befreiung der Energien des Krpers und des\nGeistes**, damit diese vollstndig dem Bewusstsein dienen. \n\n**Als Buddha Gautama von Ort zu Ort reiste**, unterrichtete er\nzahlreiche Schler, von denen auch viele den Status der Erleuchtung\nerreichten. Diese wiederum unterrichteten andere und so bildete sich\neine ununterbrochene Kette von Lehren, die bis heute weitergefhrt wird.\n\nDies sind einige der vielen berhmten Zitate von Buddha:\n\n**Der Narr, der seine Dummheit erkennt, ist weise. Aber der Narr, der\nsich fr klug hlt, ist in der Tat ein Narr.**\n**Was fr mich eine unliebe und unangenehme Sache ist, das ist auch fr\nden anderen eine unliebe und unangenehme Sache. Was da fr mich eine\nunliebe und unangenehme Sache ist, wie knnte ich das einem anderen\naufladen?**\n**Weise sind diejenigen, die ihren Krper, ihre Worte und ihren Geist\nbeherrschen.

Whrend er lange Zeit als eine\r\nOrientalische Religion galt, **gewinnt er in der letzten Zeit immer mehr\r\nan Popularitt und Einfluss in der westlichen Welt**.\r\n\r\n**Zu den berhmtesten Buddhisten**zhlen******Schauspielerinnen und\r\nSchauspieler aus Hollywood** wie: Angelina Jolie Brad Pitt Keanu Reeves\r\nRichard Gere Sharon Stone Penlope Cruz... **Sngerinnen und Snger** wie:\r\nCher David Bustamente Tina Turner... und unter vielen anderen,\r\n**der********beste Unternehmer in der modernen Geschichte, der Grnder\r\nvon Apple**: Steve Jobs.\r\n\r\n**Buddhismus**ist eine einzigartige Religion mit eigenen Rechten, obwohl\r\nsie viel mit dem Hinduismus gemeinsam hat: Die beiden Religionen glauben\r\nan Karma (Ursache und ethische Effekte), Maya (Illusion der Welt) und\r\nSamsara (Zyklus der Reinkarnation). **Buddhisten glauben, dass das\r\nultimative Ziel im Leben das Nirvana, die \"Erleuchtung\", ist und dass\r\nman sich so von der Reinkarnation befreien sollte, wie dies Buddha getan\r\nhat**.\r\n\r\nBuddha \r\nist nicht nur das Bild der rundlichen Person mit dem gutmtigen\r\nGesicht... \r\n\r\nBuddha ist die Darstellung des maximalen Zustands. Das Wort Buddha ist\r\nkein Name, es ist ein Titel oder ein Beiname und bedeutet jemand, der\r\nwach ist **im Sinne von aufgewacht in der Realitt**.\r\n\r\n**Der bekannteste Buddha ist ein Mann namens Siddharta Gautama,** der\r\nvor 2500 Jahren in Nordindien lebte. Nach jahrelangen Bemhungen gelang\r\nihm mit 35 Jahren die Erleuchtung, als er sich in tiefer Meditation\r\nbefand. Whrend den restlichen 45 Jahren seines Lebens reiste er durch\r\ngroe Teile Nordindiens, um die Lehre des **Wegs zur Erleuchtung** zu\r\nverbreiten.\r\n\r\n**Dana****,**wissen Sie, was der Buddha Gautama entdeckt hat?\r\nDass die Erleuchtung auf dem Mittelweg liegt; nicht in luxurisem Genuss\r\naber auch nicht in der Enthaltsamkeit. Auerdem entdeckte er die heute\r\nbekannten:\r\n\r\nVier edlen Wahrheiten \r\n\r\n**1. Leben ist Leiden**(Dukkha).\r\n**2. Die Ursache des Leidens ist das Verlangen**(Tanha).\r\n**3. Wer aufhrt zu verlangen, leidet nicht mehr.**\r\n**4. Die Beendigung des Leidens ist durch den edlen achtfachen Pfad\r\nmglich;**dieser beruht auf rechter 1) Einsicht 2) Denken, 3) Rede 4) Tat\r\n5) Lebensfhrung 6) Anstrengung (schlechten Instinkte zgeln und gute\r\nstrken) 7) Achtsamkeit (Meditation) und 8) Konzentration (Fokussierung) \r\n\r\n**Buddha Gautama war kein Gott** oder Gottes Prophet und er hat sich\r\nauch nie als solchen gehalten. Er hat nie behauptet, ein Gttliches Wesen\r\nzu sein. Vielmehr sah er sich als \"Richtungsweiser fr die anderen. **Im\r\nBuddhismus gibt es das Konzept von Gott des Schpfers nicht**. Buddha war\r\nein Mensch, der sich durch enorme Anstrengungen verwandelt und seine\r\nmenschlichen Grenzen berschritten hat und sich in einem neuen Zustand\r\ndes Seins **schuf**: ein Wesen der Erleuchtung. \r\n\r\n**Der Erleuchtungs-Zustand, den er erreichte, hat 3 Dimensionen:**\r\n\r\n1) **Der Zustand der Weisheit**; die Dinge so zu sehen, wie sie wirklich\r\nsind.\r\n2) **Die Quelle des Mitgefhls** oder der Liebe, die konstant dem Wohle\r\naller Wesen dienen.\r\n3) **Und es ist die totale Befreiung der Energien des Krpers und des\r\nGeistes**, damit diese vollstndig dem Bewusstsein dienen. \r\n\r\n**Als Buddha Gautama von Ort zu Ort reiste**, unterrichtete er\r\nzahlreiche Schler, von denen auch viele den Status der Erleuchtung\r\nerreichten. Diese wiederum unterrichteten andere und so bildete sich\r\neine ununterbrochene Kette von Lehren, die bis heute weitergefhrt wird.\r\n\r\nDies sind einige der vielen berhmten Zitate von Buddha:\r\n\r\n**Der Narr, der seine Dummheit erkennt, ist weise. Aber der Narr, der\r\nsich fr klug hlt, ist in der Tat ein Narr.**\r\n**Was fr mich eine unliebe und unangenehme Sache ist, das ist auch fr\r\nden anderen eine unliebe und unangenehme Sache. Was da fr mich eine\r\nunliebe und unangenehme Sache ist, wie knnte ich das einem anderen\r\naufladen?**\r\n**Weise sind diejenigen, die ihren Krper, ihre Worte und ihren Geist\r\nbeherrschen. Sie sind die wahren Meister.**\r\n**Ein Mann mag tausend Mnner in einer Schlacht besiegen, doch der grte\r\nKmpfer ist, wer sich selbst besiegt.**\r\n**So klein das Verlangen auch ist; es fesselt einen.**\r\n**Do****minieren Sie Ihre Worte, Ihre Gedanken, verletzen Sie niemanden.\r\nFolgen Sie diesen Hinweisen, dann werden Sie auf dem Weg der\r\nWeisen****fortschreiten.**\r\n**Hass wird nicht durch Hass, sondern durch Liebe besiegt.**\r\n\r\n**Dana****, dieser letzte Satz von Buddha spricht von einem alten\r\nEwigen Gesetz.** Ich kenne dieses und natrlich auch andere Ewige Gesetze\r\nund Sie wissen, dass ich Ihnen mit all meinem Wissen und meiner\r\nErfahrung zur Verfgung stehe, um Ihnen zu helfen, alle Hindernisse zu\r\nberwinden, die in Ihren Weg gelegt werden und all das Glck erhalten, das\r\nSie so sehr verdienen. **In meiner nchsten E-Mail werde ich Ihnen davon\r\nerzhlen**.

Estudei atentamente seu caso e\nelaborei esta grande vidÃªncia de sorte que mostra, de forma evidente,\nque hÃ¡ grandes mudanÃ§as no ar. \n\nComo prova, vejo grandes golpes de sorte que deverÃ£o beneficiar todos\nos aspectos da sua vidaâ€¦ Se vocÃª tivesse solicitado sua grande\nvidÃªncia de sorte, jÃ¡ teria beneficiado deste vento de mudanÃ§a que\nsopra no seu mapa astral. Em vez disso, vocÃª nada fez. Me deixe tambÃ©m\ncolocar-lhe algumas perguntas muito diretas: \n\nDeseja acabar com seus problemas atuais? Quer conhecer uma felicidade\nduradoura? Gostaria de viver com mais amor Ã  sua volta? Gostaria de\nganhar um grande prÃªmio?\n\nEntÃ£o Erico, porque nÃ£o me responde?

PorquÃª?\n\nMuito simplesmente porque seu caso me emocionou profundamente e tambÃ©m\nporque sinto entre nÃ³s uma profunda afinidade psicolÃ³gica e emocional.\nIsso significa que estou em condiÃ§Ãµes de ajudar vocÃª, tal como jÃ¡\najudei todas as outras pessoas, das quais me ocupei pessoalmente.

Tenho a certeza que daqui a alguns dias,\nvocÃª vai me escrever para me relatar sua felicidade porque todas as\ncoisas que previ para si jÃ¡ se terÃ£o, ou estarÃ£o em vias de se\nrealizar. Sou formal: a grande vidÃªncia que elaborei para si serÃ¡ como\num mapa que lhe vai indicar os bons caminhos a seguir para obter o que\nrealmente deseja.

Sim, se o tivesse feito, a esta\nhora jÃ¡ estaria a recolher os frutos do sucessoâ€¦ Em vez disso, vocÃª\ncontinua se autoquestionando para saber como vai fazer frente a todas as\nsuas dificuldades.\n\nNo entanto, Ã© muito simples. Basta que me responda. Eu tenho as\nrespostas, Erico. Tenho as soluÃ§Ãµes para que vocÃª consiga ter\nmais felicidade na sua vida. Tal como milhares de pessoas antes de si,\nconfie em mim e irÃ¡ congratular-se por isso durante muito tempo.

Estudei atentamente seu caso e\r\nelaborei esta grande vidÃªncia de sorte que mostra, de forma evidente,\r\nque hÃ¡ grandes mudanÃ§as no ar. \r\n\r\nComo prova, vejo grandes golpes de sorte que deverÃ£o beneficiar todos\r\nos aspectos da sua vidaâ€¦ Se vocÃª tivesse solicitado sua grande\r\nvidÃªncia de sorte, jÃ¡ teria beneficiado deste vento de mudanÃ§a que\r\nsopra no seu mapa astral. Em vez disso, vocÃª nada fez. Me deixe tambÃ©m\r\ncolocar-lhe algumas perguntas muito diretas: \r\n\r\nDeseja acabar com seus problemas atuais? Quer conhecer uma felicidade\r\nduradoura? Gostaria de viver com mais amor Ã  sua volta? Gostaria de\r\nganhar um grande prÃªmio?\r\n\r\nEntÃ£o Erico, porque nÃ£o me responde? Tal como lhe disse na\r\nÃºltima vez, recebo milhares de pedidos de ajuda por dia e as pessoas se\r\namontoam Ã  porta do meu gabinete de vidÃªncia. No entanto, Ã© em si que\r\npenso prioritariamente. PorquÃª?\r\n\r\nMuito simplesmente porque seu caso me emocionou profundamente e tambÃ©m\r\nporque sinto entre nÃ³s uma profunda afinidade psicolÃ³gica e emocional.\r\nIsso significa que estou em condiÃ§Ãµes de ajudar vocÃª, tal como jÃ¡\r\najudei todas as outras pessoas, das quais me ocupei pessoalmente. NÃ£o\r\nsou eu que o afirmo, mas os milhares de pessoas que me enviam\r\nespontaneamente seus testemunhos de satisfaÃ§Ã£o. \r\n\r\nClique aqui para receber sua grande vidÃªncia personalizada\r\ne seus 2 presentes gratuitos\r\n(https://oraculum.clarividencia-gratuita.com/order/ZELENGOWB5KUGX8A/jodyhaven92@gmail.com/4?utm_source=NLEN-AF-1224-BR-1505-1-40&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=10-GRV-R09)\r\n\r\nE sabe que mais, Erico?

Ã‰ agora que  tem de agir. E quando eu digo Â«agoraÂ», Ã© mesmo jÃ¡. </p>\r\n          <p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://oraculum.clarividencia-gratuita.com/order/IRS2UFOT62YZRYZ6/jodyhaven92@gmail.com/4?utm_source=NLEN-AF-1224-BR-1505-1-40&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=10-GRV-R10\">Clique  aqui para receber a sua grande vidÃªncia pessoal assim como os seus 2 presentes  mÃ¡gicos para o sucesso</a></p>\r\n          <p>Erico, se me permito insistir desta  forma Ã© porque me preocupo com a sua felicidade. Tem de acreditar. Desde que  recebi a sua solicitaÃ§Ã£o, ocupei-me prioritariamente do seu caso pessoal porque  sei que estou em condiÃ§Ãµes de ajudar vocÃª de forma concreta, para que consiga  realmente obter aquilo que o seu coraÃ§Ã£o tanto deseja. AlÃ©m disso, saiba que eu  sÃ³ me ocupo pessoalmente de casos como o seu, quando sinto um apelo vibratÃ³rio  telepÃ¡tico.  </p>\r\n          <p>Sim, desde o  inÃ­cio do nosso encontro sinto que existe entre nÃ³s uma profunda afinidade  psicolÃ³gica que posso explicar pelo fato de vocÃª ser uma pessoa sensÃ­vel,  intuitiva e dotada de grandes qualidades afetivas. Isso reforÃ§a a ligaÃ§Ã£o  telepÃ¡tica que tenho consigo. Erico,  os meus dons telepÃ¡ticos, cuja eficÃ¡cia tem sido demonstrada ao longo de 30  anos de programas de televisÃ£o e auditÃ³rios repletos de pÃºblico, permitem-me  ter uma visÃ£o mais ampla do que outros videntes. </p>\r\n          <p>Quando lhe  digo que vocÃª pode conhecer uma felicidade duradoura, pode acreditar realmente  em mim. Depois de 30 anos, milhares e milhares de pessoas que, como vocÃª,  conheceram dificuldades, podem testemunhar todos os benefÃ­cios que conheceram  na sua vida depois de eu me ter ocupado pessoalmente dos seus casos pessoais. Ã‰  exatamente isso que desejo fazer por si. </p>\r\n          <p>Como prova, a  leitura das cartas do tarÃ´ que efetuei esta manhÃ£. Concentrei-me em seu nome e  escolhi uma carta para saber sob que energias o seu dia iria estar  influenciado. Tirei a carta mais favorÃ¡vel dos tarÃ´s: tirei para vocÃª Â«A RODA  DA FORTUNAÂ» na posiÃ§Ã£o direita. Esta carta representa a Sorte com um Â«SÂ»  maiÃºsculo. Ã‰ por essa razÃ£o que vocÃª tem de me responder hoje, e agora, para  aceitar receber a sua grande vidÃªncia pessoal:</p>\r\n          <p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://oraculum.clarividencia-gratuita.com/order/IRS2UFOT62YZRYZ6/jodyhaven92@gmail.com/4?utm_source=NLEN-AF-1224-BR-1505-1-40&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=10-GRV-R10\">Clique  aqui para receber a sua grande vidÃªncia pessoal assim como os seus 2 presentes  mÃ¡gicos para o sucesso</a></p>\r\n          <p>Erico, acredite que me preocupo  verdadeiramente com o seu futuro, em especial, hoje, com a chegada de uma das  mais benÃ©ficas conjunÃ§Ãµes.

Em todo o caso, nÃ£o se\r\ntrata de uma coincidÃªncia para mim.

Esta noite, veja o que\r\npretendo fazer por vocÃª. Em primeiro lugar, saiba que esta operaÃ§Ã£o\r\nde magia cÃ³smica que vou realizar para si sÃ³ pode ser efetuada por\r\nMestres em ciÃªncias ocultas, como este seu servidor.\r\n\r\nUma hora antes da grande conjunÃ§Ã£o cÃ³smica de sorte, irei preparar o\r\nmeu altar, sobre o qual, queimarei os perfumes e as fragrÃ¢ncias\r\nmÃ¡gicas para que possa recitar os encantamentos celestes de chamamento\r\nda sorte. Em seguida, colocarei no centro do altar, um pergaminho que\r\nirei ritualizar para si. \r\n\r\nDepois, Ã  hora exata da grande conjunÃ§Ã£o, recitarei as palavras\r\nmÃ¡gicas que irÃ£o passar espiritualmente para o pergaminho mÃ¡gico.\r\nQuando a cerimÃ´nia terminar, digitÃ¡-lo-ei e enviar-lho-ei por e-mail\r\ncom a mÃ¡xima prioridade. Assim que receber o seu e-mail, encontrarÃ¡\r\ntambÃ©m as instruÃ§Ãµes secretas para transformar o seu pergaminho\r\nmÃ¡gico no seu amuleto da sorte por excelÃªncia. Para isso, deverÃ¡\r\nimprimir o seu pergaminho mÃ¡gico e utilizÃ¡-lo de acordo com as minhas\r\nindicaÃ§Ãµes, especialmente para jogar na lotaria. \r\n\r\nTal como pressenti quando estava a elaborar a sua grande vidÃªncia\r\npersonalizada, este amuleto celeste deverÃ¡ trazer-lhe sorte. EstÃ£o\r\ngrandes somas em jogo. Como previ, os prÃ³ximos dias serÃ£o prolÃ­ficos\r\na nÃ­vel sentimental e emocional. O seu pergaminho mÃ¡gico irÃ¡ dar uma\r\najuda muito benÃ©fica na obtenÃ§Ã£o daquilo que o seu coraÃ§Ã£o mais\r\ndeseja. \r\n\r\nErico, se vocÃª soubesse os milhares de pessoas que jÃ¡ tive a\r\noportunidade de ajudar atravÃ©s da realizaÃ§Ã£o das suas vidÃªncias\r\npessoais, nÃ£o hesitaria nem um minuto para solicitar a sua. \r\n\r\nClique aqui para receber a sua grande vidÃªncia e o seu presente\r\ngratuito.\r\n(https://oraculum.clarividencia-gratuita.com/order/SSX74CZCZ4URIMMF/jodyhaven92@gmail.com/4?utm_source=NLEN-AF-1224-BR-1505-1-40&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=10-GRV-R12)\r\n\r\n\r\nErico, para uma operaÃ§Ã£o deste gÃªnero, geralmente peÃ§o 250\r\ndÃ³lares de honorÃ¡rios.

Isto significa que vocÃª nÃ£o terÃ¡ de fazer nada de\nespecial. Sou eu quem se encarregarÃ¡ de todo o trabalho. Durante este\ncontacto telepÃ¡tico, proponho-me neutralizar alguns \"bloqueios\nsubconscientes\".

Contudo, vocÃª deixou passar essas oportunidades, como areia a\nescapar por entre os dedos... Por quÃª? Como verÃ¡, a razÃ£o Ã© muito\nsimples: \n\nVocÃª desenvolveu alguns \"bloqueios psicolÃ³gicos\", a que eu chamo de\n\"psicobloqueios\". Por isso, para lhe permitir que possa beneficiar deste\nencontro com a sua sorte, amanhÃ£ Ã  noite, vou neutralizar os primeiros\nbloqueios que impedem que aproveite as boas energias astrais do\nmomento... e particularmente a grande conjunÃ§Ã£o Lua VÃªnus, que nasce\nÃ s 23 horas.\n\nDesta forma, Ã s 23 horas, quando as energias desta conjunÃ§Ã£o chegarem\nao seu zÃªnite, eu agirei telepaticamente para libertar esses\n\"psicobloqueios\" que impedem vocÃª de beneficiar de todo o seu potencial\nde sorte.\n\nAgora Ã© a hora de me responder rapidamente.

Isto significa que vocÃª nÃ£o terÃ¡ de fazer nada de\r\nespecial. Sou eu quem se encarregarÃ¡ de todo o trabalho. Durante este\r\ncontacto telepÃ¡tico, proponho-me neutralizar alguns \"bloqueios\r\nsubconscientes\". A minha experiÃªncia e as minhas pesquisas no Ã¢mbito\r\nda parapsicologia e das artes divinatÃ³rias, ensinaram-me certos fatos\r\nimportantes para compreender os mecanismos da sorte...\r\n\r\nDesta forma, segundo o estudo do seu mapa astral, posso constatar que no\r\nseu passado vocÃª jÃ¡ teve muitas oportunidades para melhorar e mudar a\r\nsua vida. Contudo, vocÃª deixou passar essas oportunidades, como areia a\r\nescapar por entre os dedos... Por quÃª? Como verÃ¡, a razÃ£o Ã© muito\r\nsimples: \r\n\r\nVocÃª desenvolveu alguns \"bloqueios psicolÃ³gicos\", a que eu chamo de\r\n\"psicobloqueios\". Por isso, para lhe permitir que possa beneficiar deste\r\nencontro com a sua sorte, amanhÃ£ Ã  noite, vou neutralizar os primeiros\r\nbloqueios que impedem que aproveite as boas energias astrais do\r\nmomento... e particularmente a grande conjunÃ§Ã£o Lua VÃªnus, que nasce\r\nÃ s 23 horas.\r\n\r\nDesta forma, Ã s 23 horas, quando as energias desta conjunÃ§Ã£o chegarem\r\nao seu zÃªnite, eu agirei telepaticamente para libertar esses\r\n\"psicobloqueios\" que impedem vocÃª de beneficiar de todo o seu potencial\r\nde sorte.\r\n\r\nAgora Ã© a hora de me responder rapidamente.
