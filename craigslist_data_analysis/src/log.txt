________________________________

PAYPAL: okay,i will love to have the item as gift for my grandson who lives
and work in west africa,i wont be able to pick due to the hectic
nature of my job,i will need you to help me with shipping the item to
him.i will add $80 to your cost price for shipping..do send me your
paypal name and email id


PAYPAL: thanks for getting back to me, but unfortunately i cant call out
or receive at the moment because my 2 yrs dipped my phone into water while
playing with it and i have taken it to the store for fixing
otherwise,talking to you  would have been
okay for prompt negotiation regarding this deal.

however, i need to ask some few reasonable questions about the item.

1,what is the reason why you are selling it?

2,what is its current condition?

3,is there a reduction in the price ? though im okay with it and can pay
fully provided its excellent condition.

4,basically, do you have the original box, the binding papers such as
receipt and the certificate?

5,im a verified paypal account user and i can pay you with it, and i will
also
add $100 for shipping  to me in chula vista ca 91911 for convenience
reasons.


therefore,if you don't have a paypal account,just visit
www.paypal.com<http://www.paypal.com/> and
set up
a free account, its easy, reliable and protect transactions. so once you
send me
your paypal email associated with the account, i will send you the funds
and the $100 for shipping as slated. thanks you again and i hope to hear
back asap.

warmest regards


PAYPAL: thanks for the reply i will pay the sum of $550 via paypal because i am
buying it for someone out of state and i will like you to send me some pics
... kindly send your paypal email for payment

PAYPAL: thanks for your reply,  i am located in sacramento ca. i am seriously
interested in your listed item ,i have been trying to buy this for a

 i'm really lucky finding this at this time... i have no problem with
your asking price,just let me know how much you want me to offer you so as
to close other bids as soon as
possible,but i hope it's in a good condition.
i have no problem with paying the money upfront into your paypal
account through my paypal account since its a safe way to exchange
funds....once payment clears,shipment will be handled by me through my
personal fedex account,so you don't have to pay for shipping. if you
have an account with paypal just get back to me with your name, phone
number and verified paypal e-mail address, and i can forward to paypal
to make your payment asap but if you don't have one you can log to
paypal at www.paypal.com and easily set up your own personal account
since it's free.
i want your honesty in return to my faithfulness to you during this
transaction...
you may send me pictures of it please,and your number so i  can contact you
your immediate response is really appreciated.

now is that i can't have a state to state transaction that will not
include adequate security level, i can't send any form of cash or
paypal or bank payment for payment to anyone even money order just
because have been scammed in such a way in 2months ago, could you
believe the same thing happened to my cousin in texas last 3weeks and
is getting too much. please do think of giving a trial to cashier

assured you will be highly surprised with how everything will work out
fine

my father as gift, your asking price is quite reasonable and affordable
considering others i've seen lately, i'll take it. i would have loved to

posting as all personal dealings are highly restricted here, i really want
this as a surprise gift for my father so i won't let him know anything
about this until it get delivered to him and due to the fact that phone
calls making are restricted......i will be paying you with my paypal
account because it's attached to my bank account and its safe and very
secure way to make payment. if my mode of payment is accepted just send me
your paypal email address,(paypal id) so i can pay in right away. i have a

receipt and the certificate?

5,im a verified paypal account user and i can pay you with it, and i will
also
add $100 for shipping  to me in chula vista,ca.91911 for convenience
reasons.


therefore,if you don't have a paypal account,just visit
www.paypal.com<http://www.paypal.com/> and
set up
a free account, its easy, reliable and protect transactions. so once you
send me
your paypal email associated with the account, i will send you the funds
